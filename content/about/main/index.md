  I've spent much of the last 18 months learning R. Prior to this my focus was on data visualisation using Tableau, and even though my day job demands I work in Power BI now I have a fondness for open source technology and repeatable code.
  
  I enjoy sharing what I learn, and you can see some of that on my Datacasts YouTube channel. I'd also recommend checkng out my GitHub page, which is increasingly where I share the R code I write for my job and in my spare time.
